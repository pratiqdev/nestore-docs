# Reset the Store

Nestore can be reset to its initial state with the `.reset()` function.
All keys within the **new** store will emit a change event - values that
no longer exist in the store will not emit events.

```tsx
import nst from 'myStore.js'

nst.onAny(path => {
    console.log('Path reset:', path)
})

nst.reset()
```
